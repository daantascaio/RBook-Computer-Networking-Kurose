# Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 8/E
###### I'm reading the book Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, J.F.Kurose.

In this repository, I share solved exercises from the book I'm currently reading, along with codes and other projects I develop while studying networks. 

If you wish to access the book I'm using as a reference, you can find it available at the following [*link*](https://www.amazon.com.br/Redes-computadores-Internet-James-Kurose/dp/8582605587/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=19H4V0O32PK4U&keywords=kurose+computer&qid=1697033693&sprefix=kurose+compute%2Caps%2C192&sr=8-3&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.6121c6c4-c969-43ae-92f7-cc248fc6181d).
