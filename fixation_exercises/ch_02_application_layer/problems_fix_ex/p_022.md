### Consider distributing a file of F = 20 Gbits to N peers. The server has an upload rate of us = 30 Mbps, and each peer has a download rate of di = 2 Mbps and an upload rate of u. For N = 10, 100, and 1,000 and u = 300 Kbps, 700 Kbps, and 2 Mbps, prepare a chart giving the minimum distribution time for each of the combinations of N and u for both client-server distribution and P2P distribution
