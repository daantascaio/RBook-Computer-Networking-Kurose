### Consider an overlay network with N active peers, with each pair of peers having an active TCP connection. Additionally, suppose that the TCP connections pass through a total of M routers. How many nodes and edges are there in the corresponding overlay network?

N nodes e N(N – 1)/2 edges. Os roteadores não são considerados no grafo da overlay.
