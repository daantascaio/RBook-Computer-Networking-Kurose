### Write a simple TCP program for a server that accepts lines of input from a client and prints the lines onto the server’s standard output. (You can do this bymodifying the TCPServer.py program in the text.) Compile and execute yourprogram. On any other machine that contains a Web browser, set the proxyserver in the browser to the host that is running your server program; also con-figure the port number appropriately. Your browser should now send its GETrequest messages to your server, and your server should display the messageson its standard output. Use this platform to determine whether your browsergenerates conditional GET messages for objects that are locally cached
