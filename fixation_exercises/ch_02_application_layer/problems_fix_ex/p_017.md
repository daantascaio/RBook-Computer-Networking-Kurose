1. MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) é o agente responsável por transferir mensagens de e-mail entre servidores. Ele recebe mensagens do cliente ou de outro MTA e as encaminha para o próximo salto no caminho até o destino final. *RFC 5321 2.3*

2. O host malicioso é [58.88.21.177], pois foi o primeiro servidor a enviar o e-mail para a cadeia confiável.
