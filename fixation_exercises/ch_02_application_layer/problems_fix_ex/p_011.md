### Consider the scenario introduced in the previous problem. Now suppose that the link is shared by Bob with four other users. Bob uses parallel instances of non-persistent HTTP, and the other four users use non-persistent HTTP without parallel downloads.


a. Do Bob’s parallel connections help him get Web pages more quickly?
Why or why not?
b. If all five users open five parallel instances of non-persistent HTTP, then
would Bob’s parallel connections still be beneficial? Why or why not?
