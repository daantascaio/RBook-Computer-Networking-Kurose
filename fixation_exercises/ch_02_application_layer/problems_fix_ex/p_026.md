### Suppose Bob joins a BitTorrent torrent, but he does not want to upload any data to any other peers (so called free-riding).


a. Bob claims that he can receive a complete copy of the file that is shared by the swarm. Is Bob’s claim possible? Why or why not?

b. Bob further claims that he can further make his “free-riding” more efficient by using a collection of multiple computers (with distinct IP addresses) in the computer lab in his department. How can he do that?

---

a. É improvável que Bob consiga completar o download, pois o BitTorrent prioriza peers que também fazem upload.

b. Bob pode usar múltiplos IPs distintos (vários computadores) para contornar penalidades de não upload, parecendo múltimos peers ativos.
