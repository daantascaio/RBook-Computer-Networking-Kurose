### Consider distributing a file of F bits to N peers using a client-server architecture. Assume a fluid model where the server can simultaneously transmit to multiple peers, transmitting to each peer at different rates, as long as the combined rate does not exceed us.

a. Suppose that us/N … dmin . Specify a distribution scheme that has a distri-
bution time of NF/us.

b. Suppose that us/N Ú dmin . Specify a distribution scheme that has a distri-
bution time of F/dmin .

c. Conclude that the minimum distribution time is in general given by
max5NF/us, F/dmin 6.
