### Suppose Host A wants to send a large file to Host B. The path from Host A to Host B has three links, of rates R1 = 500 kbps, R2 = 2 Mbps, and R3 = 1 Mbps. 
####     a. Assuming no other traffic in the network, what is the throughput for the file transfer?
####     b. Suppose the file is 4 million bytes. Dividing the file size by the throughput, roughly how long will it take to transfer the file to Host B?
####     c. Repeat (a) and (b), but now with R2 reduced to 100 kbps.
