### This elementary problem begins to explore propagation delay and transmission delay, two central concepts in data networking. Consider two hosts, A and B, connected by a single link of rate R bps. Suppose that the two hosts are separated by m meters, and suppose the propagation speed along the link is s meters/sec. Host A is to send a packet of size L bits to Host B.
#### a. Express the propagation delay, dprop, in terms of m and s.
#### b. Determine the transmission time of the packet, dtrans, in terms of L and R.
#### c. Ignoring processing and queuing delays, obtain an expression for the end-to-end delay.
#### d. Suppose Host A begins to transmit the packet at time t = 0. At time t = dtrans, where is the last bit of the packet?
#### e. Suppose dprop is greater than dtrans. At time t = dtrans, where is the first bit of the packet?
#### f. Suppose dprop is less than dtrans. At time t = dtrans, where is the first bit of the packet?
#### g. Suppose s = 2.5 # 108, L = 1500 bytes, and R = 10 Mbps. Find the distance m so that dprop equals dtrans.
