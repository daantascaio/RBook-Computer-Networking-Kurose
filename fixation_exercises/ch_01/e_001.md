1) What is the difference between a host and an end system? List several different
types of end systems. Is a Web server an end system?

R:
The term 'host' is used to refer to any hardware capable of connecting to the internet, including, but not limited to, personal computers, servers, and phones, among others.

On the other hand, 'end system' is the term used to refer to any hardware that also has the ability to connect to the internet. Generally, every end system is considered a host, but not every host can be considered an end system. Despite this conceptual distinction, there is no substantial difference between the two terms.
