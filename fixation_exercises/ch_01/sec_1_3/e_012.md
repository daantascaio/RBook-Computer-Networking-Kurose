### What advantage does a circuit-switched network have over a packet-switched network? What advantages does TDM have over FDM in a circuit-switched network?

#
A circuit-switched network reserves a medium throughout the communication between points. This ensures greater predictability and stability for the network, and also enables lower latency, less header overhead, and a lower probability of data loss. It is important to note that, depending on the quality of the hardware, we can state that it will transmit data almost instantaneously. <br/>

In a circuit-switched network, TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) has several advantages over FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing):

* Bandwidth efficiency: TDM is more efficient in terms of bandwidth utilization as it allows multiple data streams to be transmitted sequentially on the same communication channel without the need to reserve fixed bandwidth.
* Lower susceptibility to interference: TDM is less susceptible to interference due to clear time division between different data streams, which reduces the likelihood of signal overlap and distortion.
* Greater flexibility: TDM offers greater flexibility in bandwidth allocation, accommodating different transmission rates for different data streams, which is particularly useful in situations where transmission rates may vary over time.
