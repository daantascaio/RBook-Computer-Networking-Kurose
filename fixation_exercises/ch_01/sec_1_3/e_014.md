### Why will two ISPs at the same level of the hierarchy often peer with each other? How does an IXP earn money?

Two ISPs, or Internet Service Providers, communicate to exchange internet traffic between their networks, which can improve connectivity and accessibility for end users, as well as optimize network efficiency and reduce costs associated with routing traffic through third-party transit providers.

An IXP, or Internet Exchange Point, typically earns money by charging membership fees to its participants, which may include ISPs, content companies, and other network organizations. Additionally, some IXPs offer additional services such as private interconnection and transport services, which can generate additional revenue.
