### Is HFC transmission rate dedicated or shared among users? Are collisions possible in a downstream HFC channel? Why or why not?

#

The data transmission in an HFC network is shared among multiple users. Collisions are not very common in this context, due to the network architecture, which is designed to allow data to travel in a single direction (unidirectional).
